Read the sections below to learn how to use each tab.")

If you are unable to do that exercise right now and would like to skip it, tap \"Stash Exercise\". When you start exercising, tap \"Start\" on the timer and tap \"Stop\" once you\'re done. If you\'d like to give yourself a 5 second countdown before starting the timer, tap the button to the left of \"Start\". After tapping \"Stop\", you will be able to select how difficult it was and tap \"Finish\". A new random exercise will then appear.")
